**describe the performance issue or opportunity**

what part of the engine is slower than expected, or where do you see an opportunity for optimization? please be specific (e.g., "query iteration for entities with many components," "asset loading time for many small files").

**describe the proposed solution**

a clear and concise description of the optimization you're proposing. this could be a change to an algorithm, data structure, or system logic.

**how can this be measured?**

describe a benchmark or profiling methodology that can be used to prove the improvement. if you have any preliminary benchmark data, please include it here.

**expected outcome**

what is the expected impact of this change? (e.g., "reduce query iteration time by 15%," "lower memory allocation during asset loading").
